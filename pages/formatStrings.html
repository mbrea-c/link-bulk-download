		Format Strings
	</h1>
	<p>
	Format strings provide a powerful way to name your downloaded files, allowing the use of information specific to each file in the saved filename by means of placeholder variables. The placeholder variables in your format string will be replaced by their corresponding value for each file you download.
	</p>
	<p>
	As an instructive example, consider the format string <code>"My file is named {name} and was the {index}th file selected"</code>. If we assume that you selected the links pointing to <code>"https://example.com/foo"</code> and <code>"https://example.com/bar"</code> in that order, the downloaded files would be named:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>My file is named foo and was the 1th file selected</code></li>
		<li><code>My file is named bar and was the 2th file selected</code></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Available placeholder variables
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><code>{index}</code> &mdash; Index of the selected link, in order of selection. 
			That is, the first link selected will have an index of 1, the second will 
			have an index of 2, etc.</li>
		<li><code>{name}</code> &mdash; Basename of the selected link. This is the
			last segment of the URI path, stripped away of the query and fragment
			components. E.g., the URI <code>"https://example.com/foo?q=test#somefragment"</code>
			would have basename <code>foo</code>.
		</li>
		<li><code>{linkText}</code> &mdash; Visible text on the selected link. This
			is (most likely) what firefox names your downloaded item when you choose
			"Save Link As..." by default.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<i>Note:</i> More placeholder variables will be added soon.
